        <h3>Physical Health</h3>
        <p>
            One of the primary and most important aspects of self-development is taking care of your physical body. One
            of the important things to learn on the spiritual path is to start listening to your body. Unsurprisingly,
            if you pay attention, your own body will start indicating to you when you are following bad habits or
            consuming things that are not suitable for your body. There are many things we consume on a daily basis that
            are extremely poisonous. Most people are so disconnected from their body that they keep consuming these
            substances, till one day they develop an illness which disrupts other important aspects of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our body talks to us in every moment, indicating when and which parts need to be stretched, to be massaged,
            to be relaxed or exercised. Listening to your body is one of the first things one must learn to develop
            before going too far on the spiritual path. The fitness of the body provides a strong foundation for a deep
            spiritual connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will find some articles on the Resources page to get you started on cleansing the body. It is
            recommended to follow a natural and healthy diet as long before the retreat as possible. Specifically, it is
            recommended to stay away from foods and substances which are heavy on the system, cause addictions, or alter
            the functioning of the body or mind in any way. Drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sugar, and caffeine (tea and
            coffee), should be avoided as much as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Mental and Emotional Health</h3>
        <p>
            A physically fit body is meaningless without a good balance of mental and emotional health. Many people are
            completely consumed by the internet and other technological entertainment available today. Thoughts are
            primarily governed by what we see and hear on the TV and internet. Emotions have been reduced to words sent
            as messages, rather than being felt within. None of this is surprising, it is significantly easier to escape
            and externalize an intense thought or emotion, rather than feel it in the moment.
            The true power of being by yourself and experiencing each emotion and thought coming from your own heart and
            mind has been largely lost in the face of technology. The concept of <em>alone time</em> is practically
            non-existent for a majority of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting in effort to purify the mind and heart prior to the retreat will greatly enhance the experience.
            It is recommended that you spend time with yourself as much as possible &mdash; watch yourself and
            experience yourself. Make a commitment to spend some time each day completely disconnected, ideally in a
            natural setting. Create a habit of not doing anything during this time. Just sit or lay down and be with
            yourself. Listen to your thoughts, emotions and your body. Enjoy the personal silence, blend into the sounds
            that surround you, and feel the connection with the present moment.
        </p>
        <h3>Remember Yourself</h3>
        <p>
            Complementary to the recommendation above, there is an exercise you can practice at all times, especially
            when you are doing something. The goal is to do any and every activity consciously, to be completely
            present. This may seem strange, but to highlight the necessity, simply take any moment from the previous
            day, and reflect on it. Were you present? Do you remember being there? Do you remember yourself from the
            inside and the outside? An easy way to test is to visit that same moment again, and see how well you can
            recreate it. The quality being tested and developed by this exercise is <b>Mindfulness</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very easy for the mind to wander when doing some activity, especially one which is mechanical or
            repetitive. Most of the times we are not present in our body &mdash; we are either reminiscing about the
            past or contemplating the future. When you commit to this exercise, the first challenge you will face is
            remembering to do the exercise itself. Remembering to remember yourself requires a certain level of presence
            in the first place. Assuming you start remembering to remember, the next challenge will be actually
            remembering yourself. You will slowly start realizing how little you are actually present in the moment. But
            do not give up, even coming to this point is a significant accomplishment, now you at least know and realize
            the reality. The next phase requires a much deeper commitment; with effort you will be able to start
            remembering yourself and being present a lot more than before. The challenge will be to keep up the effort
            and persist in this self remembrance. As you get more mindful in the moment, you will realize a much deeper
            appreciation and love for yourself, this being the ultimate goal of the exercise.
        </p>
        <h3>Entertain Productively</h3>
        <p>
            Many of the activities that we indulge in have little to no meaning. Entertainment is the easiest way to
            dull the mind and consciousness. If you must be entertained, it is beneficial to choose an activity that
            will open up new ways of thinking and feeling.
            There are a number of books and movies listed on the Resources page, which have been instrumental in
            awakening thousands of people. These books and movies are guaranteed to put you in the right mindset for the
            retreat. Observe your thoughts and feel your emotions as you go through these mind-opening and captivating
            works of art. Each piece delivers important messages about Consciousness and Spirituality in a spectacular
            and unique way.
