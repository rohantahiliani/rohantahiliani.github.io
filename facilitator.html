            My name is Rohan Tahiliani, and I will be the facilitator for this retreat. After going through a deep and
            transforming spiritual crisis, I was presented with a series of challenges and situations that kept
            preparing me and building my strength and will. Each time I conquered a challenge, I was faced with
            something tougher to throw me off. Through obsessive determination and guidance from one of the best and
            most respected teachers, I finally came to the moment of complete freedom and liberation from all the limits
            that kept me from the infinite beauty and power of the universe. After first experiencing this state, I
            realized that this is the state I want to live in every moment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Overcoming fear, shame, guilt, grief, lies, illusion and attachment, I opened up my my channels and
            connected with the objective self, higher self, source, universe, spirit or any of the million other names
            this state has been given. Going deeper into this knowledge, I started rapidly making changes in my life
            to apply and live by these principles. The work to stay on this path is endless, there are constant
            challenges and obstacles to fall out of the moment and go back to a dual state. My goal is staying in the
            moment, to live in a state of disillusionment, to finally achieve the eternal Nirvana.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Pursuing the path of truth and knowledge for multiple lifetimes, I have come to the realization that the
            only thing that matters is the moment. In the moment, a person can completely change anything and everything
            about their life. Through many personal experiences, I have found several common obstacles faced by people.
            I have been assisting and facilitating retreats at a spiritual center in Brazil and I am continuously
            learning and applying the knowledge that I have channeled over time. I simply offer to guide you and show
            the obstacles, it is still up to you to choose the changes, and do what is required to be in the moment.
        </p>
