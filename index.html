                    Welcome to the <em>Be I & Know Nothing</em> Retreat, a 7-day event which will
                    be hosted near Mumbai, India. The retreat will provide a safe, comfortable and
                    beautiful natural setting, so you can go deep within and find your true self.
                    The focus of the retreat is personal spiritual development,
                    to gain a deeper understanding of the self,
                    and to realize and break free from the limits that we place upon ourselves.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <b>The Infinite 0-1</b> is a philosophy and a way of life.
                    To understand and know Nothing, one has to be Nothing, 0, the Void.
                    It is the absence of anything and everything &mdash; no thing.
                    To reach this state, we have to take off all the masks that we wear in every moment we live.
                    It is in this Nothing, that we find ourselves, the I that is Everything.
                    I is Being an Observer, without attachment to anything.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Almost everyone today attaches several labels to I, and by doing this they limit
                    themselves from experiencing the infinite nature of I.
                    To become this infinite I, we need to realize all the dualities in our life
                    and come into the center &mdash; to a perfect balance, where you are pure Consciousness.
                    When we go deep within ourselves, we find the Nothing within that makes
                    Everything possible. It is in this Void we realize that the universe is what we
                    make it, that Nothing is the source of Everything, I, 1. It is in this space we realize
                    the Universe in it's complete infinity.
                </p>

                    This retreat is for adventure seekers, not just the kind who jump off planes, but also those
                    who enjoy diving into the inner depths of themselves. This retreat is designed to guide a
                    person like you, who is on a journey to find your true self; one who is motivated to do the
                    work required to live the life they want; one who wants to learn and know Consciousness.
                    With your dedication to be in the moment, you can learn to break out of old loops and open
                    up pathways to the infinite universe.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Throughout the week we will work together as a group. Each participant will also receive
                    personal guidance when required. We will travel to the deepest and darkest corners of ourselves,
                    only to come out stronger and ready for the infinite dance. When you are ready, you will learn to
                    reconnect with ancient knowledge and reignite the connection with the source. When you surrender,
                    you will become the universe &mdash; I.
